# timeCoordinatorApp
An app that helps people across different time zones easily figure out when they are both available. This is a student project from FreeCodeCamp.

# Current Needs
Lots of TODOs are listed in the comments, be sure to check them out.

If someone wanted to design a project page in github pages for the app, that would be cool.

Currently (March 9) the app is in need of finishing up the basic routing for APIs, as well as figuring out an appropriate
way to model the data.

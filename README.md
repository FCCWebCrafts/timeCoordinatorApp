# timeCoordinatorApp
An app that helps people across different time zones easily figure out when they are both available. This is a student project from FreeCodeCamp.

# How to Contribute
1. Fork this repo into your personal account.

2. Make your contributions locally, and then push your changes to your personal repo, not the group repo.

3. Then, make a pull request with your changes, from your personal repo to the group repo. 

This method avoids the possibility that two poeple might push conflicting changes to the repo without knowing. Making pull requests also lets everyone review new code, see what changed, and lets everyone know when to update their personal copies.

4. As the group repo gets updated, you can set up another remote on your computer to pull in new information. For example, you can have "origin" refer to your personal repo, and "upstream" refer to the FCC group repo. 


# Current Needs
Lots of TODOs are listed in the comments, be sure to check them out.

If someone wanted to design a project page in github pages for the app, that would be cool.

Currently (March 9) the app is in need of finishing up the basic routing for APIs, as well as figuring out an appropriate
way to model the data.

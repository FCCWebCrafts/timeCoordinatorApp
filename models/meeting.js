/*
TODO
 - define how users are going to input their availability data
 - members should be an array of User objects
 - admin should be the Userid of the person who created the Meeting

 - how to associate each of the avail. times with a User?
 	i.e. how should participants array/object contain refs. to User
 	objects as well as availability?
